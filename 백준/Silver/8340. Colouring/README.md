### 문제 설명

<p>A number from 1 to n is inscribed in each cell of a 2 × n grid in such a way that each number appears exactly twice in the grid and each column contains two different numbers. An example of such a configuration is depicted below.</p>

<p>We would like to colour each of the cells white or gray in such a way that cells located in the same column receive different colours and cells containing same number receive different colours. An example of such a colouring of the grid from the previous figure is depicted below.</p>
